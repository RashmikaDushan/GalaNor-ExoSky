# EXOSKY - Visualizing the Night Sky from Exoplanets

## Challenge Overview
What would the night sky look like from an exoplanet? Our project for EXOSKY!, allows users to visualize the night sky as seen from any of the 5500+ exoplanets discovered by astronomers. The Exosky challenge encourages to create an app that visualizes the night sky from various exoplanets using data from NASA’s Exoplanet Archive and star catalogs. The goal is to develop a 3D star map or interactive chart, enabling users, particularly students, to explore and name constellations. This project combines scientific data with creativity, providing an engaging educational experience that allows users to imagine the galaxy from new perspectives.

## Introduction to the Project
EXOSKY is an educational tool designed to visualize the night sky from the perspective of various exoplanets. It leverages the extensive NASA Exoplanet Archive and star catalogs such as ESA Gaia’s DR3 to provide users a unique perspective of the cosmos. Through this platform, users can select an exoplanet and view an interactive star chart.
