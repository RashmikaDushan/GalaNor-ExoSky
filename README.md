# EXOSKY - Visualizing the Night Sky from Exoplanets

## Challenge Overview
What would the night sky look like from an exoplanet? Our project for EXOSKY! The Exosky challenge encourages us to create a webapp that visualizes the night sky as seen from any of the 5500+ exoplanets.

## Introduction to the Project
EXOSKY is an educational tool designed to visualize the night sky from the perspective of various exoplanets. Through this platform, users can select an exoplanet and view an interactive star map.

## Project Goal
The goal is to develop a 3D star map, enabling users to explore exoplanet sky view. This project combines scientific data with creativity, providing an engaging educational experience that allows users to imagine the galaxy from new perspectives.

## What exactly dose it do?
nitially, the website provides a stunning view of an exoplanet from Earth, allowing users to familiarize themselves with its position. Once an exoplanet is selected, the site showcases the night sky from that perspective, revealing the unique arrangement and brightness of stars visible from that celestial body.

## How It Works

## What benefits does it have?
Educational Engagement: Helps students to understand the univers from a new perspective.
Visualization: Offers a unique way to visualize star maps based on real data.

## What do you hope to achieve?
